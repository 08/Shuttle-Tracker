The Shuttle Tracker project is intended to be a mobile equivalent of the RPI Shuttle Tracker website at http://shuttles.rpi.edu/.  A webserver and an Android client, part of the project, are in this repository. The iOS version currently has its own repository, at https://github.com/AbstractedSheep/Shuttle-Tracker-iOS
